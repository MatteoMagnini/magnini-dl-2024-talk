    % Actively Learning
    % Ontologies
    % Membership queries
    % LLMs

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Actively Learning} $\rightarrow$ a learner attempts to learn some kind of knowledge by posing questions to a teacher.
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \emph{Ontologies} $\rightarrow$ we consider the case in which the knowledge is expressed as an \EL~ontology.
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \emph{Membership queries} $\rightarrow$ the learner can ask the teacher whether a given axiom belongs to the target ontology.
    \end{itemize}
